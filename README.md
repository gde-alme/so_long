# HOW IT WORKS  

Using Minilibx, display the map given as input (map.ber).  

Use W,A,S,D to "play" the game: when one of the keys is pressed,  
the program then proceeds to check if such alteration to the map  
can be accomplished (a.k.a. "move the player") and if possible,  
displays the new map with said alteration.
